# Runbar
A simple app for running your project's npm scripts in the menubar.

### How does it work?

1. Choose the folder where you keep your projects
2. Runbar will fetch all available `scripts` from your project's `package.json`
3. Start and stop these scripts from your menubar

### Why?

If you're usually just running a watcher, then this app saves you the need to open up a terminal. Other than that it's pretty useless.

### Install
Download the Zip from the releases page, extract and place the app in your `Applications` folder.
